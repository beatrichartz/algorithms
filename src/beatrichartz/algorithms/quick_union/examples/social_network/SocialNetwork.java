/**
 Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m timestamps at which times pairs of members
 formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
 i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by
 timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be m log‚Å° n
 or better and use extra space proportional to n.
